# Angular & Express
This is a demo project of how I decided to run an express server alongside Angular server to do some REST API stuff.

## Usage (lol why)
1. Clone with     
   `git clone https://github.com/da-the-dev/angular-express.git`
2. Navigate to folder with `cd angular-express`
3. Install dependencies *(ignore vulnerabilities, these won't affect the built app)* with `npm i`     
4. Run `npm start` and go to http://localhost:4200
5. Click the thing for cats
6. Bam!
   
You can add/remove cats in `express/mocks/cats.mock.js`, soon I'll add all CRUD operations and maybe more pages.
